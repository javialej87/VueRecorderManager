### General Description

```
This application allows to retrieve, search, add and delete a series of recordings using a Json Mock file as the main data.
To achieve the database simulation a Mock service Worker has been implemented alongside the utilization of Vuex.
This two elements allows us to load data into memory and then simulate the operations given by a API.

To speed up the development process i have relied ont Vuetify which is a Vue Css Framework full of components, style helpers, etc.

There was no need in this application to configure Vue Router, because of the design. But it could be used if wanted.

```
